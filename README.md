# nHentai OpenSearch
I wanted to add nHentai search to firefox so I made this, idk how Open Search works so it's scuffed but it works.
Just go to [this](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Artemis-chan/nHentaiOpenSearch/blob/main/index.html) and you can add the search engine to your browser!
